# ALIEN-LORE-GENERATOR

# 👽 Alien Civilization Generator (Python)

Hi! This is a project I made in Python where the program creates alien civilizations by itself.
Every time you run it, it makes something new.

I made this because I like space, sci-fi, and coding, and I wanted to try building something creative instead of a normal tutorial project.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This project can:

* Generate alien species names
* Create a made-up alien language
* Turn alien words into alien symbols
* Draw alien glyphs using shapes
* Make a background story for each species
* Create a timeline showing how a civilization changes over time

Nothing is pre-written — the program generates everything.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

* Alien names are built from random syllables
* Each sound matches a symbol in an alien alphabet
* The alien writing is drawn using circles and lines
* Timelines are made by picking events across thousands of years
* Stories are created using templates and random choices

It’s all done using Python logic.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

* Python
* Google Colab
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

No paid tools or APIs.

---

## 🌌 Why I Made This

I wanted to:

* Learn more about coding
* Mix programming with storytelling
* Make something that looks cool and different

This project helped me practice:

* Writing functions
* Using lists and dictionaries
* Fixing errors and debugging

## ▶️ How to Run It

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run the cells from top to bottom
3. A new alien civilization will be generated

Thanks for checking out my project 👽
I had a lot of fun making this.
